# 3DoF Robotic Arm Control using MATLAB and SolidWorks

Integration between MATLAB and SolidWorks to control a 3DoF Robotic Arm using inverse Denavit-Hartenberg kinematics.

Included in this files you can find:
  - SolidWorks model I used to get the describe the robot along with squematics
  - Denavit-Hartenberg parameters table with the values of α, θ, a and d of such robot
  - MATLAB function for direct kinematics using Denavit-Hartenberg
  - MATLAB function for inverse kinematics using Denavit-Hartenberg (used to control the robot)
  - MATLAB/SolidWorks integration in MATLAB.

Have fun learning,
Javier.
